 * sent to the auth child.
 *
 * Sending the wake-up keypress to the auth child is usually a bad idea because
 * many people use "any" key, not their password's, to wake up the screen saver.
 * Also, when using a blanking screen saver, one can't easily distinguish a
 * locked screen from a turned-off screen, and may thus accidentally start
 * entering the password into a web browser or similar "bad" place.
 *
 * However, it was requested by a user, so why not add it. Usage:
 *
 * XSECURELOCK_DISCARD_FIRST_KEYPRESS=0 xsecurelock
